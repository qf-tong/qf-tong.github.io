<section class="introduction">
    <h1: style="margin-top: 15;">Hi I'm Qingfeng!</h1>
    
    <p>
        I am currectly receiving doctoral training at the Department of Linguistics and Communication, University of Birmingham, UK, supervised by Dr Marcus Perlman and Dr Gerardo Ortega. Before that, I studied at the University of Edinburgh in developmental linguistics with a shift to language evolution.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am focusing on
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Perceptual modality</strong>: How have the differences in perceptual modality (e.g., visual vs. auditory) influenced the multimodal communication? Are the differences from physical apparatus or from the way we perceive the signals?</li>
        <li><strong>The evolution of writing systems</strong>: How did human writing systems, from ideographic forms, come to represent speech sounds?</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive science</strong>：Language of Throught; Parallel Architecture; The origin of language... </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
