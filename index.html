    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Perceptual modality**：How have the differences in perceptual modality (e.g., visual vs. auditory influenced the multimodal communication? Are the differences from physical apparatus or from the way we perceive the signals?</li>
        <li>**The evolution of writing systems**：How did human writing systems, from ideographic forms, come to represent speech sounds?</li>
        <li>**Cognition**：Language of Throught; Parallel Architecture </li>
    </ul>
