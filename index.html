    <h2>Research Interests</h2> 
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Perceptual modality</strong>: How have the differences in perceptual modality (e.g., visual vs. auditory) influenced the multimodal communication? Due to physical apparatus or the way we perceive the signals?</li>
        <li><strong>The evolution of writing systems</strong>: How did human writing systems, from ideographic forms, come to represent speech sounds?</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive science</strong>：Language of Throught; Parallel Architecture; The origin of language... </li>
    </ul>
