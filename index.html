    <h1>Hi I'm Qingfeng!</h1>
    
    <p>
        I am currently receiving doctoral training at the Department of Linguistics and Communication, University of Birmingham, UK, supervised by Dr Marcus Perlman and Dr Gerardo Ortega. Before that, I studied at the University of Edinburgh in developmental linguistics with a shift to language evolution (supervised by Prof Kenny Smith).

    <h2>Research Interests</h2> 
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Perceptual modality</strong>: How have the differences in perceptual modality (e.g., visual vs. auditory) influenced the multimodal communication? Due to physical apparatus or the way we perceive the signals?</li>
        <li><strong>The evolution of writing systems</strong>: How did human writing systems, from ideographic forms, come to represent speech sounds?</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive linguistics</strong>：Language of Thought; Parallel Architecture; The origin of language... </li>
    </ul>
